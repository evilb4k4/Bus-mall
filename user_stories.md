Dev: Bus mall would like an app that gathers data on what product their customer would like to see in there catalog.

1. Present a user with an option of 3 picture and have the picture clickable so the user can select a picture of the item the user would like to purchase.

2. As the user select an image the app should automaticlly refresh with 3 new images to select ones again(Do this 25 times).

3. when the user has reached 25 votes the app should display a result list of the most selected images.
