Dev: Bus mall would like an app that gathers data on what product their customer would like to see in there catalog.

1. As user i would like an option of 3 picture and have the picture clickable so the user can select a picture of the item the user would like to purchase.

2. As the user when I select an image on the app it should automaticlly refresh with 3 new images to select onece again(i should be able to do this 25 times).

3. when i reach has 25 votes the app should display a result list of the most selected images.
